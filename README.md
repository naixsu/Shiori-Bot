# Shiori Bot
A personal discord bot project using python and google sheets api. Main goal of this project was to leverage google sheets api and python. The bot features mainly two things: calculating overtime (OT) hits and tracking hits from players. Note that this project is not replicable as only I have the google sheets credentials available
